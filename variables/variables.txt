Python Variables:
        Variable is a name that is used to refer to memory location.
        Python variable is also known as an identifier and used to hold value.

        We don't need to specify the type of variable because Python is a infer language 
        and smart enough to get variable type.

        Variable names can be a group of both the letters and digits, 
        but they have to begin with a letter or an underscore.

        It is recommended to use lowercase letters for the variable name. 

        The equal (=) operator is used to assign value to a variable.
 
        variables are a symbolic name that is a reference or pointer to an object.
        The variables are used to denote objects by that name.
        Ex: 
          a = 50
          b = a

Naming:
        The first character of the variable must be an alphabet or underscore ( _ ).

        All the characters except the first character may be an alphabet of lower-case(a-z), 
        upper-case (A-Z), underscore, or digit (0-9).

        Identifier name must not contain any white-space, or special character (!, @, #, %, ^, &, *).

        Identifier name must not be similar to any keyword defined in the language.

        Identifier names are case sensitive; for example, my name, and MyName is not the same.

        The multi-word keywords can be created by the following method:
        Camel Case - nameOfStudent, valueOfVaraible, etc.
        Pascal Case - NameOfStudent, etc.
        Snake Case -  name_of_student, etc.

Multiple Assignment:
        1. Assigning single value to multiple variables:
        Ex: 
            x=y=z=50    
        2. Assigning multiple values to multiple variables:
        Ex:
            a,b,c=5,10,15    


  



type(): Checks the type of objects.
id(): Object Identity
      Ex:
          a = 50  
          b = a  
          print(id(a))  
          print(id(b))  
          # Reassigned variable a  
          a = 500  
          print(id(a))
          
del: Deletes a variable
